Notes on DNA/RNA assembly, assemblers and tooling

# HiCanu
HiCanu consensus sequences using PacBio HiFi data are typically well above
99.99% We discourage any post-processing/polishing of these assemblies as
mis-mapping within repeats can introduce errors.

# Canu
Canu consensus sequences are typically well above 99% identity for PacBio
datasets. Nanopore accuracy varies depending on pore and basecaller version,
but is typically above 99% for recent data. Accuracy can be improved by
polishing the contigs with tools developed specifically for that task. We
recommend Arrow for PacBio and Nanopolish or Medaka for Oxford Nanpore data.
When Illumina reads are available, FreeBayes can be used to polish either
PacBio or Oxford Nanopore assemblies.
