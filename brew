-Install hub via brew install hub in the Terminal.
- cd $(brew --repo homebrew/science)
- Fork Homebrew-science repository with hub fork (enter GitHub username and password)
- Create branch to work on updated formula : git checkout -b muscle-3.8.1551.
- brew edit muscle
- edit url to the URL of the latest release. In the case of muscle I also had to update the version field.
- in the Terminal get the latest release: brew fetch muscle
  brew will complain about hash mismatch since formula still contains old hash;just copy provided hash into sha256 field of muscle.rb
- The formula has a revision field, so remove that line as itâ€™s a new version.
- run brew install -vsd --git muscle
- Hopefully the new release compiles!

# pin/unpin
brew list --pinned		# list pinned software
brew pin tomcat			# pin
brew unpin <package_name>	# unpin

# install old / other version of tool -- use git hash url
e.g. brew install https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/raw/869efd7bc8/Formula/kubernetes-helm.rb
