# examples
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/results?dataPortal=pathogen #results that can be searched against in the pathogen data portal.
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/searchFields?result=assembly #fields that can be searched for the assembly result.
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/returnFields?result=analysis #fields that can be returned in the report for the analysis result
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/controlledVocab?field=checklist #CV for checklist. Note value and label contain different content; value is what should be used in the search query label gives the title of each checklist.
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/controlledVocab?field=instrument_model # CV for instrument_model. Note the value column contains understandable values, the label column holds the same information.

# Search against public samples
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/search?result=sample&limit=0 #Find all public samples in ENA portal. Return accession and title, ordered by accession.
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/search?result=sample&dataPortal=pathogen&fields=sample_accession,tax_id,scientific_name,collection_date,country,location&sortFields=scientific_name,sample_accession&limit=0  # all accessions, tax id, etc. of public samples in pathogen portal. Sort results by scientific name, followed by sample accession.

# Search against public samples with paging
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/search?result=sample&dataPortal=ena &fields=all&offset=100&limit=100&format=json # Submit same search as above, without sorting, but requesting ALL result fields, and using an offset and limit, in json format. Useful for paging.
curl -X GET --header 'Accept: text/plain' –u 'username:password' 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/search?result=read_run&limit=20000 0&dataPortal=pathogen' #Authenticated search for a dataPortal and results download • Using CURL, submit a search with the username and password.

#Search against data hub (DCC) data only
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/search?result=read_run&fields=fastq_ftp,fastq_md5&dccDataOnly&limit=0 # Find all read data registered with dcc_chopin. Return a list of the run accessions with FTP FASTQ file links. Include the MD5 checksums for the files. Note that this example URL doesn’t include the data hub account information, this must be included in the request header. Note also that the URL has been changed to HTTPS so that the account information is secure during transit.

#Search for read data using sample fields
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/search?result=read_run&query=collection_date>=2016-01-01%20AND%20collection_date<=2016-12-31%20AND%20tax_tree(590)&fields=fastq_ftp,fastq_md5&limit=0 # Find all public Salmonella reads from 2016. Return list of run accessions with FTP FQ links. Include the MD5 checksums for the files.
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/search?result=read_run&query=collec tion_date>=2016-01-01%20AND%20collection_date<=2016-12- 31%20AND%20tax_tree(590)&fields=fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,sample_accession,collection_date&limit=0 # same search, but return sample accession and collection date in addition to the read file data. Note that while the above search will return one row for each run accession, the following search will return one row for each run- sample combination.
