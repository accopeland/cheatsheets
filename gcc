#versions of gcc (>4.3) support  -frecord-gcc-switches which adds some compile symbols to the binary which we could search later if needed like so;

# profile guided optimization : 5-30%
instrument programs to produce profiling information, then use that information to rebuild the executable with better optimizations.
flags: -fprofile-generate, and in a subsequent invocation, -fprofile-use
##
$ gcc -fprofile-generate=path-for-profiling-files source.c  -o program  #Build the program instrumented with the profiling support:
$ ./program #Run . It will produce profile information in files that the final step consumes:
$ gcc -fprofile-use=path-of-profiling-files source.c -o faster_program #Use the profiling information files produced in step 2:
You need to use these flags both in the linking step and in steps that only create object files.


# gcc PGO (see also LTO
-fprofile-generate=path-for-profiling-files: instrument binary with profiling code, run binary, log events that could improve performance if
usage pattern known at compile time. 	  After program exits, dump data into *.gcda . Rebuild with
-fprofile-use  : take *.gcda data into account when optimizing, usually increasing the performance significantly.

# build on MacOS 10.14.6 and 10.15.3
3/2020 - gcc 8.3.0 (build only) and master(full bootstrap and test) on macOS 10.14.6 and 10.15.3, each with Xcode 11.3.1.
Both worked *provided the build and target compilers were configured with the
approriate --with-sysroot to account for the lack of /usr/include and startup
objects in /usr/lib*.

Prerequisites
ISO C++11 compiler - Necessary to bootstrap GCC.
C standard library and headers - build GCC, the C std lib + headers must be present for all target variants for which target libraries will be built
	--disable-multilib <=  ‘fatal error: gnu/stubs-32.h: No such file’
bash - A “working” POSIX compatible shell, or GNU bash. zsh is not a fully compliant POSIX shell and will not work when configuring GCC.
POSIX/SVR4 awk - for creating some generated source files . If in doubt, use a recent GNU awk version, as some of the older ones are broken. GNU awk version 3.1.5 is known to work.
binutils - Necessary in some circumstances, optional in others. See the host/target specific instructions for your platform for the exact requirements.
gzip version 1.2.4 (or later) or bzip2 version 1.0.2 (or later) - Necessary to uncompress GCC tar files when source code is obtained via HTTPS mirror sites.
make version 3.80 (or later) -You must have GNU make installed to build GCC.
tar version 1.14 (or later) -Necessary (only on some platforms) to untar the source code. Many systems’ tar programs will also work, only try GNU tar if you have problems.
Perl version between 5.6.1 to 5.6.24 - when targeting Darwin, building ‘libstdc++’, and not using --disable-symvers. Necessary when targeting Solaris 2 with Solaris ld and not using --disable-symvers.
GMP Multiple Precision Library version >= 4.3.2 - build GCC. If a GMP source distribution is found in a subdirectory of your GCC sources named gmp, it will be built together with GCC.
MPFR Library version 3.1.0 (or later) - build GCC.  downloade https://www.mpfr.org. If an MPFR source distribution is found in a subdirectory of your GCC sources named mpfr, it will be built together with GCC. Alternatively, if MPFR is already installed but it is not in your default library search path, the --with-mpfr configure option should be used. See also --with-mpfr-lib and --with-mpfr-include. The in-tree build is only supported with the MPFR version that download_prerequisites installs.
MPC Library version 1.0.1 (or later) - Necessary to build GCC. It can be downloaded from https://www.multiprecision.org/mpc/. If an MPC source distribution is found in a subdirectory of your GCC sources named mpc, it will be built together with GCC. Alternatively, if MPC is already installed but it is not in your default library search path, the --with-mpc configure option should be used. See also --with-mpc-lib and --with-mpc-include. The in-tree build is only supported with the MPC version that download_prerequisites installs.
isl Library version 0.15 or later. -Necessary to build GCC with the Graphite loop optimizations. It can be downloaded from https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/. If an isl source distribution is found in a subdirectory of your GCC sources named isl, it will be built together with GCC. Alternatively, the --with-isl configure option should be used if isl is not installed in your default library search path.
zstd Library. - Necessary to build GCC with zstd compression used for LTO bytecode. The library is searched in your default library patch search. Alternatively, the --with-zstd configure option should be used.

# Error:  'ld: library not found for -lSystem'
# Fix:
a) xcode-select --install  #   Install the Xcode command-line utilities:   sudo xcodebuild -license # accept license if required
b) export LDFLAGS="-L/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib" #"-Wl,--rpath ...bison..."
# linker flags verbose
-ldflags="-linkmode=external -v"

Clang option to catch uninitialized memory reads: -fsanitize=memory. That option cannot be combined with -fsanitize=address.

# omp
On macOS, install GCC compiler since Clang has issues with OpenMP library:

# Error: error: 'uint64_t' has not been declared
# Fix: #include <cstdint>
