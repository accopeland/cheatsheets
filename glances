# description
cross-platform  curses-based monitoring tool that aims to present a maximum of information in a minimum of space, ideally
fitting in a classic 80x24 terminal or larger for more details. It can adapt dynamically to the displayed information  depending  on  the
terminal size.  It can also work in client/server mode.  Remote monitoring can be performed via a terminal or web interface.
