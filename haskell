# notes
# [Lazy evaluation] makes it practical to modularize a program as a generator that constructs a large number of possible answers, and a selector that chooses the appropriate one.

# definitions
Functors are generalized loops:  [ f x | x <- xs];
Applicatives are generalized nested loops:  [ (x,y) | x <- xs, y <- ys];
Monads are generalized dynamically created nested loops:  [ (x,y) | x <- xs, y <- k x].
