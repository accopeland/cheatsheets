# hmmscan vs hmmsearch (2011 : https://cryptogenomicon.org/2011/05/27/hmmscan-vs-hmmsearch-speed-the-numerology/)
	- Pfam is about 1 GB of data
	-  when comparing lots of seqs to lots of models use hmmsearch
	-  to search 300 million ~200nt metagenomic reads against Pfam use hmmsearch

# hhsuite

# hhblits
HHblits  claims to be 20x faster than HMMER and considerably  more  sensitive  than  HMMER3 and PSI-BLAST
HHblits is an accelerated HHsearch that is fast enough to iteratively  search through millions of profile  HMMs

# hhsearch - searches a query profile HMM hrough database of target profile HMMs.

# hhsuite dbs
hhm format not really convertible from hmm format

# hmmpgmd \ /hmmer/src/hmmpgmd_client_example.pl \ hmmc2
(1) Generate an hmmpgmd format file, including map file, from a FASTA format
    file, for example using the HMMER/Easel tool esl-reformat:
  prompt% esl-reformat --id_map my.hmmpgmd.map hmmpgmd my.fasta > my.hmmpgmd
(2) Start the hmmpgmd master/worker, run the following commands:
  prompt% hmmpgmd --master --seqdb my.hmmpgmd
  prompt% hmmpgmd --worker 127.0.0.1 --cpu 4
(3) Run this client to connect to the master
(4) Submit one query to hmmpgmd for each sequence in the query file, retrieve results
    from the master, then unpack the custom (and undocumented) binary. Examples of
    unpacking the binary are seen in the unpackXXX() functions.
