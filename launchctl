Usage: launchctl <subcommand> ... | help [subcommand]

Many subcommands take a target specifier that refers to a domain or service
within that domain. The available specifier forms are:

system/[service-name]
Targets the system-wide domain or service within. Root privileges are required
to make modifications.

user/<uid>/[service-name]
Targets the user domain or service within. A process running as the target user
may make modifications. Root may modify any user's domain. User domains do not
exist on iOS.

gui/<uid>/[service-name]
Targets the GUI domain or service within. Each GUI domain is associated with a
user domain, and a process running as the owner of that user domain may make
modifications. Root may modify any GUI domain. GUI domains do not exist on iOS.

session/<asid>/[service-name]
Targets a session domain or service within. A process running within the target
security audit session may make modifications. Root may modify any session
domain.

pid/<pid>/[service-name]
Targets a process domain or service within. Only the process which owns the
domain may modify it. Even root may not do so.

When using a legacy subcommand which manipulates a domain, the target domain is
inferred from the current execution context. When run as root (whether it is
via a root shell or sudo(1)), the target domain is assumed to be the
system-wide domain. When run from a normal user's shell, the target is assumed
to be the per-user domain for that current user.
