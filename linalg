# linear dependence
Thus, a set of vectors is linearly dependent if and only if one of them is zero or a linear combination of the others.

# linear independence
A sequence of vectors is linearly independent if and only if it does not contain the same vector twice and the set of its vectors is linearly independent.

# LI geometry
* \vec u and {\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}{\vec {v}} are independent and define the
plane P.
* \vec {u}}\vec u, {\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}{\vec{v}} and {\displaystyle {\vec {w}}}{\vec {w}} are dependent because all three
are contained in the same plane.
* {\vec {u}}\vec u and {\vec {j}}{\vec {j}} are dependent because they are parallel to each other.
* {\vec {u}}\vec u , {\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}{\vec {v}} and {\vec {k}}\vec k are independent because
{\vec {u}}\vec u and {\vec {v}}{\vec {v}} are independent of each other and  {\vec {k}}\vec k is not a linear combination of them or,
equivalently, because they do not belong to a common plane. The three vectors define a three-dimensional space.
* The vectors {\vec {o}}{\vec  o} (null vector, whose components are equal to zero) and {\vec {k}}\vec k are dependent since
{\vec {o}}=0{\vec {k}}  {\vec {o}}=0{\vec {k}}

* LI
If there are more vectors than dimensions, the vectors are linearly dependent. This is illustrated in the example above of three vectors in
