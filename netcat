# Use netcat to listen for incoming TCP connections on port 3000:
This instance of netcat is considered a "listener" and is now waiting for a connection.
nc -l -p 3000 #Note: old versions of netcat consider using -l and -p incorrect usage e.g. this would work instead for old versions of netcat nc -l 3000

# Use netcat to establish a TCP connection (run in a new terminal window so as to not conflict with listening netcat instance):
nc localhost 3000 #You've set up both ends of the TCP connection. type into one terminal and hit <Enter>, you see what you typed in the other window. 

# to send HTTP request 
#  need two terminal windows again
nc -l -p 3000 # In the first we'll again be listening on port 3000:
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/ # in other use curl to send HTTP request to localhost:3000 
Now in the listening netcat terminal window type the following, then <Enter> and then stop the netcat instance w <Ctrl-c> to see the HTML response 

<h1>hello world</h1>
If you try this from both the terminal and from a proper browser request, you'll notice a slight difference between sending a curl request and sending a HTTP request from your browser:

curl request:

GET / HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: curl/7.37.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:3000
Accept: */*
browser request:

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:3000
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8

# You can turn netcat into a temporary webserver (you'll need a index.html file):
nc -l -p 8888 < index.html
Then hit http://127.0.0.1:8888/index.html in your web browser
Note: use a loop for have netcat server indefinitely
while true; do nc -l -p 8888 < index.html; done

# You can stream files from a listener to a client with netcat:
Listener:
nc -v -w 30 -l -p 8080 < some-file.txt
Client:
nc -v -w 2 127.0.0.1 8080 > stream-content.txt
