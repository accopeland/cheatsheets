# description
yet another attempt to mitigate totally braindead python installation process. Creates and manages a venv for every single
thing you install with it. Still better than pip I guess.

# nope -- fucking python PEP668 broke this
# nope install
#python3 -m ensurepip
#python3 -m pip install --user pipx

# install
brew install pipx

# usage
pipx install globus-cli
