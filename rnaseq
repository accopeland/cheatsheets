bcbio recommendations (and pipeline) for rnaseq: (http://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents/pipelines.html)
	We recommend using the STAR aligner for all genomes where there are no
	alt alleles. For genomes such as hg38 that have alt alleles, hisat2 should be
	used as it handles the alts correctly and STAR does not yet. Use Tophat2 only
	if you do not have enough RAM available to run STAR (about 30 GB).

rnaseq adapter trimming recommendations:
	aligners that soft clip the ends of reads such as STAR and hisat2, or algorithms using pseudoalignments like Sailfish handle contaminant sequences at the ends properly.

rnaseq alignment-free quantitation - Sailfish
	Sailfish is an extremely fast alignment-free method of quantitation. Sailfish can accurately quantitate the expression of genes, even ones which are hard to quantitate with other methods

bcbio single-cell rnaseq:
	recommend using UMI (Universal Molecular Identifiers)

bcbio::smallRNA-seq
	adapter trimming - cutadapt
	seq align - STAR for annotation (or bowtie2/hisat2)
	smRNA quant - seqbuseter for miRNA; tdrmapper for tRNA
	QC - fastqc
	other smrna classification - seqcluster , mirDeep2

bcbio::chipseq
	Adapter trimming: - cutadapt
	Sequence alignment: - bowtie2
	Peak calling: - macs2
	Quality control: - FastQC


kallisto is 3x faster than hisat

Kallisto uses pseudoalignments
