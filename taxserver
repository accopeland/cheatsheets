Notes on JGI taxonomy server (taxonomy.jgi.doe.gov)

# deploy

# resources
~80 GB RAM currently (It doesn't need nearly that much - ~ 40G should be adequate)
IIRC - but it is set to use 80G because that seemed to reduce OOM exceptions that occur due to
unstable hardware.  CPU requirements are pretty slight.

# sketch servers combined currently use 90 GB RAM.  Those have slightly
higher CPU requirements and a minimum of 8 cores would be ideal.  The disk
space of both is less than the memory requirements and they only need to touch
the dist when starting up.

# background (2022 June)
The systems all seemed perfectly stable for months until some upgrade was done
on the VMs, and they've never been stable since, but I've never been able to
determine the cause; it's almost always the OS deciding to kill the process
because the system is out of memory, even though when I start the process there
is 30-40 GB free.  Somewhere the OS has a higher-priority process that randomly
swells to take up all the free memory on the system, causing the user processes
to be killed.  I'm not sure what that process is doing, though it would make
sense to me if it was buffering network traffic.
